Movies App - Technical Overview
3. Implemented Features & Key Design Choices
Here's what's built into the app:

Tab Bar Animation: The bottom tab bar hides when scrolling down on lists and reappears when scrolling up.

Faster Search: Search results load efficiently by waiting for you to finish typing before sending a request.

Offline Data & Quick Loading: Movie information is saved directly on your device.

Saved Movies: You can bookmark your favorite movies, and they will stay saved in the app.

Structured Code (MVVM): The app uses a clear, organized way to build its features (MVVM).

Clear Navigation: How you move through the app is managed separately from the screens themselves.

Auth Interceptor: An authentication interceptor has been added.

4. Areas for Future Development
These features were planned but not completed due to time limits:

Loading Long Lists: The app doesn't yet load very long lists of movies in smaller sections.

Direct Movie Links: You can't currently share a direct link that opens straight to a specific movie's details page in the app.

Cache Refresh: Saved movie data on your device doesn't automatically refresh after a set time.
